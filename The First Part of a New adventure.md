**Lesson 1:**

Today was the start of a new lesson with a new teacher. Mr. Tansley.

This lesson we started by using an Excel spreadsheet to set up an imaginary business

I sold clothes and we had to code in Excel so when we click on an item, the price would

Automatically add up. This was quite hard so it took everyone the whole lesson to do it.

Next week, I will try and concentrate more on what he's saying and not think I can already do it.
