    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I learnt by reading and understanding the booklet. Then once I knew how and why it works I made it slightly different so it really embedded in my head. For example , if the booklet said that there were 3 LEDs involved I would do it with 4.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
What limited my learning in today's lesson was when I worked by myself, instead of listening to my partner. He offered a different perspective on it and I ignored it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
Next time, I will improve my learning and make it much easier, I will listen to my partner's perspective. This will give me another view on the CLS code.</td>
