**My Half-Term Homework**

* Our IT teacher gave us the task of doing an hour and a half of codecademy.

* This homework took me the whole week to complete for many reasons:

    * We had to revise for end of year exams in this week as well.

    * I forgot about for the first half of the week.

    * I had a week full of other activities too.

* I mainly did it in the last couple of days as otherwise I would of just completely forgotten about it.

* We were supposed to do 10 minutes every other day.
