    <td>Last lesson I started to code the robot arm.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target was to pick things up with the robot arm.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 
Today's effective learning strategies were when I copied the booklet and then understood why it worked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
The habits I need to work on are, not blindly copying the booklet and not relying on my partner all the time </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
Next term, as today was our last lesson, I will remember my targets (not blindly copying the booklet). If I don't remember these targets, then the whole project will have been pointless.</td>
