    <td>During the lesson, I think my learning was easiest when my partner and I followed the manual, but changed it slightly to understand it more, and to make it our own. I also think a useful strategy was when we talked to other groups to compare differences and similarities.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning was when I didn't think that I was wrong, but the groups we were talking with were wrong, instead of asking myself, am I wrong, and does what i have make sense.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>To change next week, to make my learning easier for next week I will bring a pen drive so I donâ€™t have to start again every week, and I will also, learn to make comparisons with other groups by telling each other our differences so we can learn more easily.</td>
