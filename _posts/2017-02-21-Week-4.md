    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>

The effective learning strategies that I used were, when I was listening to what my partner had to say, and thinking about how the code worked before moving on to something new straight away.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

What limited my learning was that when I found a challenge I immediately asked someone instead of thinking about it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

What I will change for next time is when I find a challenge or difficulty, I will try and solve it instead of asking someone because then I don't learn.</td>
