    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

My most effective learning strategies during today's lesson were: reading thoroughly the book before actually blindly copying random code so we could understand it fully, and also working with groups around us..</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

What limited my learning was the fact that I didn't focus and got distracted by other people and I need to work just focusing on my work, and not the people around me. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>

Next lesson, to make our learning even easier, my partner and I will concentrate more on our work and less on the people around us so we can a lot of work done</td>
