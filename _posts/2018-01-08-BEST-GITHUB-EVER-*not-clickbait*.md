**Lesson 2:**

Today was the start of a another new lesson with a new teacher. Mr. Tansley.

This lesson we started by putting in V-Look-ups! These are super cool!

I sold clothes and we had to code in Excel so when we click on an item, the price would

Automatically add up. This was quite hard so it took everyone the whole lesson to do it.

Next week, I will try and do something new.
